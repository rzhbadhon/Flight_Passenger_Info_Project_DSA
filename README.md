A simple **C++ project** built as part of my **DSA Lab** coursework.  
This program manages flight passenger information using **Linked Lists** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  

It allows you to:  
- ➕ Add passenger information  
- 📋 Display all passengers  
- 🔍 Search passengers by **name** or **seat number**  
- ✏️ Edit passenger details (name, destination, or seat number)  
- ❌ Remove a passenger from the flight  

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Linked List Implementation**: Dynamic storage of passenger records.  
- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulation of passenger data in a `node` class.  
- **Search Options**: Search by **name substring** or **seat number**.  
- **Edit Functionality**: Update passenger details interactively.  
- **Delete Functionality**: Remove passengers by seat number.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++  
- **Concepts**: Linked List, Classes & Objects, Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add **GUI support** for better user experience  
- Store passenger data in **files or databases** for persistence  
- Improve **search efficiency** with advanced data structures  
- Add **input validation** and error handling

## 📝 Previous README
> Flight Paasengr Information System (No GUI).  
> This was one of my DSA LAB project.  
> I used C++ for this project.  
> I used linked list and oop for this.  
> This code can store flight passenger information, delete, or change/edit info, search by seat number or by name.  
> I will try to improve my code in the future. Thank You.
